Real estate decision-making requires the assessment of interdisciplinary datasets, which include socioeconomic, financial, and environmental data. Determining evolving patterns, analyzing and visualizing them, is critical in holistically assessing an area and a real estate decision to be made. This course aims to provide you with an opportunity to improve your coding ability and demonstrate that using [R](https://www.r-project.org) is more replicable and efficient than Excel.

We will work in groups to solve tricky data analytics & visualization problems. Of course, we will encounter a lot of new commands and new ways of thinking about how data is organized. However, we will most importantly learn how to understand the process of data analysis and how to best inform our audience and honestly describe the underlying data. The course is developed based on materials from [Dr. Feiyang Sun at UC San Diego](https://fsun.ucsd.edu/), Siman Ning, and Christian Phillips.
