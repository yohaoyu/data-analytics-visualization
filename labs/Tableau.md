# Lab 04 - Tableau

## Part A - Descriptive Statistics and Tables

In class, I will provide a general orientation to Tableau. Next class I will have a guide for you to follow along to learn more technical aspects of Tableau. 

**Homework**

 Nationwide Redfin data (at the state level) attached here:

**Arrange these sheets into a dashboard**. Make sure that any filters that you apply on your dashboard work on all (relevant) sheets. If you want, play around with creating multiple story points.

**Submission:**

Submit your [tableau packaged workbook ( .tbwx ).Links to an external site.](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/save_savework_packagedworkbooks.htm) This will include any excel files that you attach so that when you share the file anyone with Tableau can open it!

We are assuming that the file you are uploading to Tableau is **already in a fairly clean format.** If it is not clean and nicely wrangled, you would need to use R or TableauPrep to get in the proper format

## Part B - Advanced Tableau

Tableau has a lot of menus within menus, a lot of pointing and clicking. I think it would be tedious to have us all walk through an example of constructing a Tableau dashboard together because you can get lost quite quickly. Instead, it's more helpful if you can follow along with a guide because you can stop and go back and see exactly what buttons are being pressed in order to replicate it for yourself. I think the Tableau guide I have selected is a great beginner to intermediate example of how to create a snazzy dashboard. 

**Your task:**

It would be difficult to complete this assignment in pairs. **Therefore, this is an individual assignment(see my note at the end about accessing Tableau)**. Follow along with [this guide on youtube Links to an external site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKAarfLRQ)and try to recreate the dashboard as best you can. It took me a little over an hour to replicate, stopping and replaying the video to see exactly what he was doing. He covers a lot of tools, especially a lot of formatting tools. Up until the very end where he is assembling the final dashboard, try to follow along as precisely as possible. If you make a mistake earlier it might be hard to catch and resolve later. I will open a discussion post so if anyone has any question on the walkthrough myself or another classmate can offer advice and the rest of the class can see the response to the question. 

In addition to following the tutorial and replicating the dashboard, I would like you to write up a paragraph explaining what this dashboard does well, and what you would do differently. 

You will need these two excel files:

[Countries.csv](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1692283/files/136712528?wrap=1)[Download Countries.csv](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1692283/files/136712528/download?download_frd=1)
[ba_reviews.csv](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1692283/files/136712544?wrap=1)[Download ba_reviews.csv](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1692283/files/136712544/download?download_frd=1)

Some tips:

- He uses a lot of keyboard shortcuts that he doesn't always explain. Mac and Windows keys are different. In general, you can try control, command, shift (Mac) or a combination of these keys to see what works for you.
- Sometimes it can be confusing to access the formatting pane for a particular measure or attribute. Make sure you watch exactly where he is right clicking to get the formatting pane for that object to appear. Also you can hit the x in the formatting pane to close it and get back to your measures and attributes view if you're in a sheet. 
- When he drags and drops the various measures into each sheet he often holds control the entire time to get the menu to pop up that allows him to select "average", "sum" etc. Alternatively to this, you can drag it in first, then use the carrot on the pill to select how you want the data aggregated, like I demonstrated in class. 

 

**Submission:** 

Save as a **Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx)**. You can submit your paragraph as a word doc or write in the comments of the submission. 

 

Have a Happy Thanksgiving! As always, feel free to message me if you have any issues or concerns but if your question is Tableau-specific then maybe starting in the discussion board is the best place.

Everyone should be entitled to a student license with Tableau with your @uw.edu email. If you are having trouble with your Tableau license, it seems like the computers in Digital Commons in Gould have Tableau installed. You may also be able to remote access a UW server.

If you have issues accessing Tableau that persist let me know.
