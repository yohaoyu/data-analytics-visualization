# Lab 01 - Basic of R

## Part A - Setup R & R Studio

Setup, R Basic, Markdown, Download via API

Try to complete this before the first class. The goal of this assignment is simply to make sure that you have R up and running and can knit a .rmd file to an .html and upload both to canvas. We will go over ggplot more in depth in week 2, but feel free to look through the World Bank data and make your own visualizations using this dataset. 

Make sure to change your name in the header of the document. 

Please upload both the .html & .rmd. 



Use install.packages("[package name]") to install any required packages, or R Studio may automatically recognize that there are some packages you need to install and will install them for you. 

If R & RStudio aren't running and installing properly you may need to update your operating system. Don't worry too much if you can't get them installed and running, I just want everyone to make an attempt which should save you time later on.

## Part B - Basic of R and Markdown

Create a brief Résumé / CV using R Markdown with your name as the title, headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold. Try and incorporate as many R Markdown features as possible. Submit both the .Rmd and .html files
