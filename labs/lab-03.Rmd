<!-- start of the main lab content --> 

The due day for each lab can be found on the [course wesbite](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/). The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other files required to rerun the codes. **For Lab 1‚Äì3, the use of any generative AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) is prohibited**. We will run AI detection on each submission. More information about [Academic Integrity](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#academic-integrity) and [the Use of AI](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#use-of-ai).

## Lab 03-B: Table, A Little Programming, Visualization and GitHub


### Very Simple Git and GitHub

- Every change you make is saved in history, so you can always go back.
- If something breaks, you can roll back to a working version.
- Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other.
- Your code and documents are safe, even if your computer crashes.
- Most of the data science ecosystem (R packages, Python libraries, statistical models, tutorials) lives on GitHub.

There are two main ways to use GitHub:

1. Terminal (Command Line) ‚Äì more powerful and professional, gives you full control.
2. [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) ‚Äì easier for beginners, has a user-friendly interface.

We will using GitHub Desktop:

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
2. [Sign up a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
3. Sign in with your GitHub account on GitHub Desktop.
4. Create a [new public repository](https://github.com/new).
5. Click ‚ÄúClone a repository‚Äù to copy from GitHub to your computer.
6. Add this `.Rmd` and `html` to your local repository.
7. Commit changes with a short message (e.g., ‚ÄúLab 1 for RE 519‚Äù).
8. Click ‚ÄúPush origin‚Äù to upload your changes back to GitHub.
9. You can check your changes on GitHub now. 

### üìö TODO: 

Using the National Mortgage Database data create a very pretty table of descriptive statistics using any table package. I suggest either looking at the **Outstanding Residential Mortgage Statistics** for **States** or **Residential Mortgage Performance Statistics** for **States.**

[https://www.fhfa.gov/data/national-mortgage-database-aggregate-statisticsLinks to an external site.](https://www.fhfa.gov/data/national-mortgage-database-aggregate-statistics)

In your table, show basic summary statistics such as mean, median, min/max, 25th/75th percentiles, for both Washington and the rest of the US. 

Additionally, create 3-4 ggplots that would make sense to view side by side in a grid and try to make the plots in the grid connect together (ex. similar legend, color scheme, title) as well as tell an interesting story. You may want to connect state-level statistics from ACS with the NMDB data (make sure you are comparing data from the same year). 

Be sure to review the technical documentation to understand what the statistics represent. You will likely need to filter or pivot_wider() the data since it is in a long format. 

Add one paragraph explaining your table and charts.
