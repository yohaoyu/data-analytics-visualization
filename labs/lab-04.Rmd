<!-- start of the main lab content --> 


The due day for each lab can be found on the [course wesbite](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/). The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other files required to rerun the codes. From Lab 4, the use of any generative AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) is allowed. But, I still encourage you to write codes by yourself and use AI tools as a way to debug and explore new knowledge. More information about [Academic Integrity](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#academic-integrity) and [the Use of AI](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#use-of-ai).

## Lab 04: Visualization using R and ggplot2

```{r message=FALSE}
library('tidyverse')
library('ggplot2')
```

### GitHub Copilot (Optional)

Please allow me first introduce [GitHub Copilot for RStudio](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html), an AI coding assistant. GitHub Copilot is available as an opt-in integration with RStudio. Because of the rapid development of AI, tools like Copilot, OpenAI's GPT, Claude are becoming common in data science workflows. It has dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for data analysis and visualization across industries. As a student, we can use it freely!

1. Open [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education)and click `Join GitHub Education`.
2. Log in your GitHub account. 
3. Under "GitHub Education", click `Start an application`.
4. Complete the form, then click `Submit application`.
5. Once your application is approved, you will receive an Email. 
6. Open `Edit - Settings` in RStudio, you can see `Copilot` on the left bar.
7. `Enable GitHub Copilot`, then `Sign in`.
8. Authorize RStudio to access your GitHub account.

You can also use other AI services, such as [Gemini from Google](https://gemini.google.com/), [ChatGPT from OpenAI](https://chatgpt.com/), or [Copilot from Microsoft](https://copilot.microsoft.com). Note: Microsoft Copilot with [commercial data protection](https://uwconnect.uw.edu/it?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0034403) is enabled for UW faculty, staff, and students.
