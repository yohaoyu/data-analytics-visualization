# Lab 06 - Interaction and Dashboard

## Part A - RShiny

This is a challenging topic within R. We will try to figure out how to best implement RShiny together. It can get complicated quite quickly because RShiny requires a different style of coding than we are used to: 

- "In **imperative** programming, you issue a specific command and it’s carried out immediately. This is the style of programming you’re used to in your analysis scripts: you command R to load your data, transform it, visualise it, and save the results to disk."
- "In **declarative** programming, you express higher-level goals or describe important constraints, and rely on someone else to decide how and/or when to translate that into action. This is the style of programming you use in Shiny."

Additionally, tidyverse in Rshiny starts to be not so helpful. RShiny seems to be best implemented with base R :( In any case we can try to work around this and use LLM to our advantage to breeze through translating the type of visualization we want into an RShiny app.
