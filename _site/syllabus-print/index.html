estate decision-making requires the assessment of interdisciplinary datasets, which include socioeconomic, financial, and environmental data. Determining evolving patterns, analyzing and visualizing them is critical in holistically assessing an area and a real estate decision to be made. This course aims to provide you with an opportunity to improve your coding ability and demonstrate that using <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> is more replicable and efficient than Excel.</p><p>We will work in groups to solve tricky data analytics &amp; visualization problems. Of course, we will encounter a lot of new commands and new ways of thinking about how data is organized. However, we will most importantly learn how to understand the process of data analysis and how to best inform our audience and honestly describe the underlying data. The course is developed based on materials from <a href="https://fsun.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Feiyang Sun at UC San Diego</a>, Siman Ning, and Christian Phillips.</p><h2 id="learning-objectives"> <a href="#learning-objectives" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="learning-objectives"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Learning Objectives</h2><p>After successfully completing this course, you should be able to:</p><ol><li>Create, debug, debug again, then submit scripts to perform data analysis in R using RStudio<li>Import data in variety of formats; including interacting with APIs to access public databases<li>Be more aware of the real estate data landscape in the US, Washington, and the Puget Sound region<li>Wrangle data using the tidyverse package; manipulate, combine, and collapse datasets<li>Map data and understand the challenges when working with spatial data<li>Interpret data visualizations, document, and present your data analysis using R Markdown<li>Understand the basic taxonomy of data analysis methods and conduct regression and basic machine learning models<li>Know essential concepts in deep learning and artificial intelligence<li>Understand ethical challenges in applying AI and data science to real-world contexts</ol><p>Overall, students are expected to gain proficiency in identifying the appropriate analysis and visual method based on the dataset they have and the message they would like to convey.</p><h2 id="pre-requisites"> <a href="#pre-requisites" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="pre-requisites"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Pre-requisites</h2><ul><li>Basic knowledge of statistics is required (e.g., R E 506, URBAN 520, STAT 221).<li>Basic knowledge of any programming language (e.g., CS&amp;SS 508, CSE 160) is recommended but not required.</ul><h2 id="readings-and-class-materials"> <a href="#readings-and-class-materials" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="readings-and-class-materials"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Readings and Class Materials</h2><ul><li><strong>Class slides</strong> for every lecture will be posted on the course website before the lectures.<li><strong>Required readings</strong> are identified for each class and should be completed as preparation before coming to class.<li><strong>Optional readings</strong> are useful for the class topics and I encourage you read them bfore the class.

I am willing to discuss questions you might have. Acts of academic misconduct may include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Cheating (working collaboratively on quizzes and exams, sharing answers, etc.).<li>Plagiarism (using another person’s words or ideas without proper citation).<li>Unauthorized collaboration (working with others on assignments without acknowledgment).<li>Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication.</ul><h2 id="use-of-ai"> <a href="#use-of-ai" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="use-of-ai"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Use of AI</h2><p>In this course, students are permitted to use AI-based tools (such as ChatGPT) on some assignments. The instructions for each assignment will include information about whether and how you may use AI-based tools to complete the assignment. All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. Detailed citation guidelines can be found at the <a href="https://lib.law.uw.edu/bluebook101/genai">UW Law Library</a>, <a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-AI-tools">MIT Libraries</a>, and the <a href="https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=1340355&amp;p=9896961">UMD Libraries</a>. Using AI in ways inconsistent with the parameters above will be considered academic misconduct and subject to investigation.</p><p>Please note that AI results can be biased and inaccurate. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. Additionally, pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content you share, so be careful not to unintentionally share copyrighted materials, original work, or personal information.</p><p>Learning how to thoughtfully and strategically use AI-based tools may help you develop your skills, refine your work, and prepare you for your future career. If you have any questions about citations or about what constitutes academic integrity in this course or at the University of Washington, please feel free to contact me to discuss your concerns.</p><p>According to the academic integrity requirements, we prohibit the use of AI-based tools to directly complete assignments, as well as conducting discussions and reflections in any section during class. However, we encourage students to use generative AI tools to assist with coding, debugging, and understanding class content.</p><p>You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, as you would use a human collaborator. This means that you may NOT directly ask generative AI tools for answers or copy solutions. You’re required to acknowledge generative AI tools as collaborators and include a paragraph describing how you used the tool. The use of generative AI tools to substantially complete an assignment or exam (e.g., by directly copying) is prohibited and will result in honor code violations. We will be checking students’ assignments to enforce this policy.</p><h2 id="disability-resources-for-students-drs"> <a href="#disability-resources-for-students-drs" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="disability-resources-for-students-drs"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Disability Resources for Students (DRS)</h2><p>Your experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have already established accommodations with <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">Disability Resources for Students (DRS)</a>, please activate your accommodations via myDRS so we can further discuss.</p><p>If you have not yet established services through DRS but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but are not limited to mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or health impacts), contact DRS directly to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations.</p><h2 id="campus-safety"> <a href="#campus-safety" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="campus-safety"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Campus Safety</h2><p>Call SafeCampus at 206-685-7233 to anonymously discuss safety and well-being concerns for yourself or others.
