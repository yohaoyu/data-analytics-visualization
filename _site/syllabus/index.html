financial, and environmental data. This course aims to provide you an opportunity to improve your coding ability and demonstrate that using R is more replicable and efficient than Excel.</p><p>We will work in groups to solve tricky data wrangling &amp; visualization problems. Of course, we will encounter a lot of new commands and new ways of thinking about how data is organized. However, we will most importantly learn how to create a visualization that will best inform our audience and honestly describe the underlying data.</p><h2 id="learning-objectives"> <a href="#learning-objectives" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="learning-objectives"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Learning Objectives</h2><p>After successfully completing this course you should be able to:</p><ol><li>Create, debug, debug again, then submit scripts to perform data analysis in R using RStudio<li>Import data in variety formats; including interacting with APIs to access public databases<li>Be more aware of the real estate data landscape in the US, Washington, and the Puget Sound region<li>Wrangle data using the tidyverse package; manipulate, combine, and collapse datasets<li>Map data and understand the challenges when working with spatial data<li>Understand the basic taxonomy of a time series and basic forecasting techniques<li>Interpret data visualizations, document, and present your data analysis using R Markdown</ol><p>Overall students are expected to gain proficiency in identifying the appropriate visual method based on the dataset they have and the message they would like to convey.</p><h2 id="pre-requisites"> <a href="#pre-requisites" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="pre-requisites"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Pre-requisites</h2><ul><li>Basic knowledge of statistics is required (e.g., R E 506, URBAN 520, STAT 221).<li>Basic knowledge of R, Python, or other programming languages (e.g., CS&amp;SS 508, CSE 160) is recommended but not required.</ul><h2 id="readings-and-class-materials"> <a href="#readings-and-class-materials" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="readings-and-class-materials"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Readings and Class Materials</h2><ul><li><em>Class slides</em> for every lecture will be posted on the course website before the lectures.<li><em>Required readings</em> are identified for each class and should be completed as preparation before coming to class.<li><em>Optional readings</em> are useful for the class topics and I encourage you read them bfore the class.</ul><h2 id="computing"> <a href="#computing" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="computing"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Computing</h2><p>No previous programming experience is required, but appreciated. All required analytics applications will be in Microsoft Excel. R or Python is encouraged but not required; students who use R or Python to complete at least six assignments will be awarded extra credit. We will have an installation session during the first and second computing workshops.</p><p>Bring your computer (Windows, MacBook, or Linux is acceptable) to the assigned lab session in the calendar. If you have any trouble with having a computer, you may check the computing resources from <a href="https://be.uw.edu/spaces/computing/">the college</a>, <a href="https://stlp.uw.edu">Student Technology Loan Program</a>, or <a href="https://www.lib.washington.edu/services/computers/computers">UW libraries computer service</a>. Students are also welcome to conduct any needed computer-based work in the Digital Commons in the basement of Gould Hall or other computer labs on campus.</p><h2 id="course-requirements"> <a href="#course-requirements" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-requirements"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Requirements</h2><div class="table-wrapper"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Labs</strong><td>60%<tr><td><strong>Participation</strong><td>30%<tr><td><strong>Final Projects</strong><td>10%</table></div><p>It is highly recommended that students attend the course regularly, as the sessions will be offered synchronously and will not be recorded. We will use class time to do necessary activities. Class attendance and participation are integral parts of this course; much of the key material will be introduced and discussed in lectures. Good note-taking skills are essential, since the instructor often discusses material and provides examples that may not be directly quoted on the slides. Students are expected to keep track of the schedule and assignment due dates.</p><p>According to the estimates for UW courses, it should take about 9 hours of work to complete a three-credit class each week. If you spend more than 5 hours beyond the classroom, please let us know, and we will adjust the study plans for you.</p><p>The total scores will be curved and transformed into the UW numerical grading system for graduate courses, ranging from 4.0 to 1.7 in 0.1 increments as the final grade.</p><p>Late days: You will have 6 penalty-free late days in total (max 3 late days per assignment). Any delayed submission after the first 3 days will be penalized 10% per day for that specific assignment (but will not count towards your used late days).</p><h3 id="labs-60"> <a href="#labs-60" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="labs-60"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Labs (60%)</h3><p>There will be a total of 8 labs. HW 0 is intended for reviewing mathematical concepts and will not be added to the total grade; 5% each for the other 8 assignments. Each assignment will take approximately one week, and the expected finish time is around 2-3 hours. Each student is expected to submit their own assignments, but study groups are allowed. But you’re expected to acknowledge the names of collaborators along with a short description of the types of collaborations being done at the beginning of each assignment submission. You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT, but please check the AI policy section.</p><p>Details for each homework will be released after the previous homework is due. All homework will be due at 11:59 pm Pacific Time and should be submitted on Canvas. You can typeset or scan your assignment, but you should upload a PDF rather than submitting as images.</p><h3 id="final-projects-30"> <a href="#final-projects-30" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="final-projects-30"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Final Projects (30%)</h3><p>There will be a ﬁnal exam in the final week (based on UW’s arrangement). The exam will cover all the content in modules 1-4, including topics like descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression. The exam is closed-book; however, each student is permitted to bring a letter-size double-sided cheat sheet. Calculators will be provided if computation is needed, but you are allowed to bring your own calculators.</p><h3 id="participation-10"> <a href="#participation-10" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="participation-10"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Participation (10%)</h3><h2 id="communication-and-community-forum"> <a href="#communication-and-community-forum" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="communication-and-community-forum"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Communication and Community Forum</h2><p>You can reach us via Ed Discussion, email, and in person during class and office hours. Please use the Ed Discussion as the first place to ask general questions. If you have a question about the course material or assignment, other students may have the same question. If you email me with a question like this, I will ask you to post it on the discussion board. I will review the discussion board at least once a day (weekdays). I also encourage students to answer each other’s questions on the discussion board. For emails, we try to reply to emails within 24 hours, 48 hours over a weekend, and the workday following a holiday unless otherwise noted. Simple questions will be answered by Ed Discussion or email, but students may be asked to schedule a meeting for more complex discussions.</p><h2 id="course-evaluation"> <a href="#course-evaluation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-evaluation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Evaluation</h2><p>Formal course evaluation occurs at the end of the quarter, university-widely.

Students are held responsible for any violation of the University of Washington Student Code, irrespective of whether the violation was intentional or not. Students suspected of cheating or otherwise violating the misconduct code will be referred to the College disciplinary process. Behaving with integrity is part of our responsibility to our shared learning community. If you’re uncertain about whether something is academic misconduct, ask me. I am willing to discuss questions you might have. Acts of academic misconduct may include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Cheating (working collaboratively on quizzes and exams, sharing answers, etc.).<li>Plagiarism (using another person’s words or ideas without proper citation).<li>Unauthorized collaboration (working with others on assignments without acknowledgment).<li>Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication.</ul><h2 id="use-of-ai"> <a href="#use-of-ai" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="use-of-ai"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Use of AI</h2><p>In this course, students are permitted to use AI-based tools (such as ChatGPT) on some assignments. The instructions for each assignment will include information about whether and how you may use AI-based tools to complete the assignment. All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. Detailed citation guidelines can be found at the <a href="https://lib.law.uw.edu/bluebook101/genai">UW Law Library</a>, <a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-AI-tools">MIT Libraries</a>, and the <a href="https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=1340355&amp;p=9896961">UMD Libraries</a>. Using AI in ways inconsistent with the parameters above will be considered academic misconduct and subject to investigation.</p><p>Please note that AI results can be biased and inaccurate. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. Additionally, pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content you share, so be careful not to unintentionally share copyrighted materials, original work, or personal information.</p><p>Learning how to thoughtfully and strategically use AI-based tools may help you develop your skills, refine your work, and prepare you for your future career. If you have any questions about citations or about what constitutes academic integrity in this course or at the University of Washington, please feel free to contact me to discuss your concerns.</p><p>According to the academic integrity requirements, we prohibit the use of AI-based tools to complete assignments and exams, as well as conducting discussions and reflections in any section during class. However, we encourage students to use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to assist with coding, debugging, and understanding class content.</p><p>You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, as you would use a human collaborator. This means that you may NOT directly ask generative AI tools for answers or copy solutions.
