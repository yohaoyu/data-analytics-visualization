You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, as you would use a human collaborator. This means that you may NOT directly ask generative AI tools for answers or copy solutions. You’re required to acknowledge generative AI tools as collaborators and include a paragraph describing how you used the tool. The use of generative AI tools to substantially complete an assignment or exam (e.g., by directly copying) is prohibited and will result in honor code violations.

    "content": "| In-class Quizzes | 15% | . | Weekly Assignments | 40% | . | Critical Thinking Activity | 15% | . | Final Exam | 30% | . | Extra Credits | 5% | . It is highly recommended that students attend the course regularly, as the sessions will be offered synchronously and will not be recorded. We will use class time to do necessary activities, like quizzes. Class attendance and participation are integral parts of this course; much of the key material will be introduced and discussed in lectures. Good note-taking skills are essential, since the instructor often discusses material and provides examples that may not be directly quoted on the slides. Students are expected to keep track of the schedule and assignment due dates. According to the estimates for UW courses, it should take about 15 hours of work to complete a five-credit class each week. If you spend more than 8 hours beyond the classroom, please let us know, and we will adjust the study plans for you. The total scores will be curved and transformed into the UW numerical grading system for graduate courses, ranging from 4.0 to 1.7 in 0.1 increments as the final grade. In-class Quizzes (15%) . There will be at least 5 in-class quiz sessions throughout the quarter, each one will take 25 minutes. Those quizzes are intended to review and help you understand basic statistics concepts. The quizzes are open-book and notes, but no electronic devices are allowed. If you cannot attend the class with a quiz, please let us know in advance. Assignments (40%) . There will be a total of 9 assignments. HW 0 is intended for reviewing mathematical concepts and will not be added to the total grade; 5% each for the other 8 assignments. Each assignment will take approximately one week, and the expected finish time is around 2-3 hours. Each student is expected to submit their own assignments, but study groups are allowed. But you’re expected to acknowledge the names of collaborators along with a short description of the types of collaborations being done at the beginning of each assignment submission. You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT, but please check the AI policy section. Details for each homework will be released after the previous homework is due. All homework will be due at 11:59 pm Pacific Time and should be submitted on Canvas. You can typeset or scan your assignment, but you should upload a PDF rather than submitting as images. Late days: You will have 6 penalty-free late days in total (max 3 late days per assignment). Any delayed submission after the first 3 days will be penalized 10% per day for that specific assignment (but will not count towards your used late days). Critical Thinking Activity (15%) . Final Exam (30%) . There will be a ﬁnal exam in the final week (based on UW’s arrangement). The exam will cover all the content in modules 1-4, including topics like descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression. The exam is closed-book; however, each student is permitted to bring a letter-size double-sided cheat sheet. Calculators will be provided if computation is needed, but you are allowed to bring your own calculators. Extra Credits (5%) . There will be two opportunities to receive extra credit. For the winning team in each debate session, all team members will be awarded 2% extra credit. For students who use R or Python for at least six of their assignments, they will be awarded 3% extra credit. ",
