    "content": "As we learn more about data visualization, we have begun to discuss some general principles. For today’s lab exercise, please find an example of a visualization or infographic that impresses you- either in a good or bad way. Please attach the example image, give the link/source, and (1) describe what the visualization is trying to communicate; (2) discuss what it does and does not do well using the principles we talked about in class; (3) comment on two visualizations posted by classmates . -– . A few probing questions to think about: . | Is the data visualization static, motion or interactive? | Is it narrative or explorative? | What kind of purpose do you think it serves? How would you order its objectives (appeal, comprehension and retention)? | Does it contain the basic elements of a graph (e.g. title, axis label, encoding)? Is anything missing or not clear to audience? | What kind of encoding does it use (e.g. position, length, slope, angle, area, color hue, etc)? How effective in terms of precision of such encoding elements? | What kind of organization principles do you observe (e.g.hierarchy, unity, balance, grouping and spacing)? Is principle lacking in the graph? | Do you think your psychological needs have all been met by this source (e.g. autonomy, relatedness and competence)? | . ",

    "title": "Lab 3.2: Sketching Dataset",
    "content": "In this exercise, you will sketch (with pen and paper!) 3 visualizations of a small dataset and provide brief reflections of your designs. Why sketch? Why not just dive right into coding or using some visualization tool? Sketching is a quick and cheap form of prototyping — a process of simulating how a finished product could look and work. Prototyping is a critical part of the design process as it allows us to test the feasibility of our ideas early on. But prototyping (and sketching, in particular) is also extremely helpful in generating ideas. Rather than grappling with the functionality of any given design tool (which can often influence your design process, even implicitly), or committing to any one specific design, sketching allows us to more rapidly explore the space of possible designs. In this assignment, you are going to gain some practice with sketching visualizations. Redfin Monthly Housing Market Data . Each week, Redfin releases a dataset about the housing market, computed daily as either a rolling 1, 4 or 12-week window. The local data is grouped by metropolitan area and by county. The dataset contains information such as median sale price, home sales, pending sales, new listings, inventory, active listings, monthly supply, days on market, price per square foot, sale to list ratio, percent of home sold above list, percent of active listing with price drops, and percent of homes go off market within two weeks. The attached dataset contains the above information aggregated for all types of homes. Dataset: Redfin_SEA_Metro_Au2024.csvDownload Redfin_SEA_Metro_Au2024.csv . Source: https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/Links to an external site. Your Tasks . | Start by choosing a question you’d like a visualization to answer. | Design 3 different visualization paper sketches (low-fidelity prototypes) that you believe effectively tackle the question. | Write one paragraph per sketch about the rationale for your design decisions. What was your motivation behind generating this sketch? What Ire you hoping it would communicate? What worked and what didn’t? | Write one paragraph that reflects on all 3 of your sketches overall. Compare your designs with each other — what are their strengths and weaknesses? What new directions might you explore (e.g., synthesizing elements from every sketch, or describing why one of them is significantly better than the others?). | . Your sketches should be interpretable without consulting your write-ups. Do not forget to include the title, axis labels or legends as needed! . The goal of this assignment is to draft different visualization designs. Thus, I do not expect your visualizations to be “perfect,” but rather communicate three ideas that you would plausibly be excited to continue exploring in the subsequent assignment. In fact, I encourage you to use sharpies/markers/felt-tip pens so that your lines are thicker and you are less focused on being “accurate.” . Note: For this assignment, you should not analyze or visualize the data with tools such as Excel, Tableau, or R. I instead expect you to just look at the dataset and create hand-drawn sketches. Grading . This assignment is scored out of a maximum of 10 points. I will determine scores by judging the diversity of your sketches, the creativity of your ideas, and the crispness of your write ups. You can be awarded a maximum of 3 points for each sketch and its related reflection. The remaining 1 point will be awarded for communicating your overall reflection across the 3 sketches as described in the above section “Your Tasks”. Submission Details . This is an individual assignment. You may not work in groups. Submit your assignment on canvas. Compile your sketches and writeups as a single PDF or WORD file. Make sure your images are sized for a reasonable viewing experience — readers should not have to zoom or scroll in order to effectively view any sketch! . Tips and Inspiration . | Use a sharpie/marker. Thick lines free you from worrying about the fine-grained details and accuracy of your sketch, and instead focus you on sketching the big picture ideas. | Similarly, I recommend using pens over pencils — not being able to “undo” your mistakes by erasing them can be remarkably conducive to generating designs. | You are free to use different colors and any other sketching techniques you can think of (e.g., dotted patterns, cross hatching, etc.). | You may sketch on touchscreen-enabled devices (e.g., iPads). | How to Sketch, Doodle, and Draw Data Visualization Drafts by HandLinks to an external site. | Sketching with Data Opens the Mind’s EyeLinks to an external site. | .

    "content": "This is a challenging topic within R. We will try to figure out how to best implement RShiny together. It can get complicated quite quickly because RShiny requires a different style of coding than we are used to: . | “In imperative programming, you issue a specific command and it’s carried out immediately. This is the style of programming you’re used to in your analysis scripts: you command R to load your data, transform it, visualise it, and save the results to disk.” | “In declarative programming, you express higher-level goals or describe important constraints, and rely on someone else to decide how and/or when to translate that into action. This is the style of programming you use in Shiny.” | . Additionally, tidyverse in Rshiny starts to be not so helpful. RShiny seems to be best implemented with base R :( In any case we can try to work around this and use LLM to our advantage to breeze through translating the type of visualization we want into an RShiny app. Read (required): .

Be sure to use the function I have in the .Rmd to correct the standard errors for heteroskedasticity. | Your first specification should be a naive model, the most basic kind of regression that connects two variables together. | Your second should include multiple regressors (while being cautious to avoid introducing perfect/imperfect multicollinearity, i.e. variables that are highly correlated with each other) | Your third specification should include some sort of controls for fixed effects (such as at the state level, MSA level etc.) | . Select the model you think explains the relationship the best using adjusted R2, F-statistic, AIC, BIC (use what you think makes sense). Then interpret each of the regression coefficients. What does the intercept represent in your chosen model? . Write one paragraph that explains why this relationship might exist in the data. Even if you are not confident in the accuracy of the coefficient, its sign might give you some information about the relationship between these variables. ModelVisualization.RmdDownload ModelVisualization.Rmd . -—- . Play around with how you enter the variables into your model, such as taking the natural log, introducing some terms that are squares or cubes, or interact two variables. Remember that when you introduce a higher order term such as Var^2 you must also include its lower order in your specification ex: var + var^2. The same is true for variables that are interacted together. This lesson could be, and often is, an entire class, so just try and get the gist. I want to expose you to these types of statistics because they are used often by data analysts and will lay the foundation for forecasting. ",

If you are interested in deeper knowledge about data science, this class will also give you a foundation to pursue future work. The final project is your opportunity to put these skills, both covered in the class and any other techniques, into practice. Students are encouraged to work individually or in teams of up to three people. Please sign up with your group information using the Canvas Assignment provided. Your first task is to select a project topic. Please start to think about that now! Some students may share related datasets on Ed Discussion, and I compile a list of datasets under Resources - Datasets. Also, I will be happy to brainstorm with you and suggest datasets and research questions anytime. The project could be, for example: . | Applied Data Analysis: Through exploratory data analysis and modeling, such as regression, machine learning techniques, on interesting real estate or urban datasets, to generate new insights. | Interactive Visualization: Producing interactive visualization or dashboard on multiple real estate-related datasets using R or Tableau, with the goal of generating new insights. | Methodological Exploration: A project that applies a statistical or machine learning method, which we did not cover in the course, to real estate or spatial data, and evaluates its performance. | Replication of an Academic Article: Replicate an interesting academic article in the field of real estate. You can use the same datasets with the author or not. | . Ideally, projects will blend elements of these categories. Strong projects often emerge from people who have a dataset they are passionate about or a policy problem they want to investigate. If you are already engaged in research or work where real estate data plays a role, you are welcome to adapt your project to that context. There are five deliverables, together accounting for 30% of the total grade: . | Team Formation (1% of the total grade) | Project Proposal (5% of the total grade) | Draft Work Presentation (8% of the total grade) | Final Delivery (15% of the total grade) | Peer Review (1% of the total grade) | .

You do not need to prepare formal slides for the presentation. Instead, focus on clearly explaining your work so that your classmates can understand your approach and agree with your findings. The class and I will provide preliminary feedback on your work as well as how to appropriately wrangle your data sources.

Determining evolving patterns, analyzing and visualizing them, is critical in holistically assessing an area and a real estate decision to be made. This course aims to provide you with an opportunity to improve your coding ability and demonstrate that using R is more replicable and efficient than Excel. We will work in groups to solve tricky data analytics &amp; visualization problems. Of course, we will encounter a lot of new commands and new ways of thinking about how data is organized. However, we will most importantly learn how to understand the process of data analysis and how to best inform our audience and honestly describe the underlying data. The course is developed based on materials from Dr. Feiyang Sun at UC San Diego, Siman Ning, and Christian Phillips. ",

Determining evolving patterns, analyzing and visualizing them is critical in holistically assessing an area and a real estate decision to be made. This course aims to provide you with an opportunity to improve your coding ability and demonstrate that using [R](https://www.r-project.org) is more replicable and efficient than Excel. We will work in groups to solve tricky data analytics & visualization problems. Of course, we will encounter a lot of new commands and new ways of thinking about how data is organized. However, we will most importantly learn how to understand the process of data analysis and how to best inform our audience and honestly describe the underlying data. The course is developed based on materials from [Dr. Feiyang Sun at UC San Diego](https://fsun.ucsd.edu/), Siman Ning, and Christian Phillips. ## Learning Objectives After successfully completing this course, you should be able to: 1. Create, debug, debug again, then submit scripts to perform data analysis in R using RStudio 2. Import data in variety of formats; including interacting with APIs to access public databases 3. Be more aware of the real estate data landscape in the US, Washington, and the Puget Sound region 4. Wrangle data using the tidyverse package; manipulate, combine, and collapse datasets 5. Map data and understand the challenges when working with spatial data 6. Interpret data visualizations, document, and present your data analysis using R Markdown 7. Understand the basic taxonomy of data analysis methods and conduct regression and basic machine learning models 8. Know essential concepts in deep learning and artificial intelligence 9. Understand ethical challenges in applying AI and data science to real-world contexts Overall, students are expected to gain proficiency in identifying the appropriate analysis and visual method based on the dataset they have and the message they would like to convey. ## Pre-requisites - Basic knowledge of statistics is required (e.g., R E 506, URBAN 520, STAT 221). - Basic knowledge of any programming language (e.g., CS&SS 508, CSE 160) is recommended but not required. ## Readings and Class Materials - **Class slides** for every lecture will be posted on the course website before the lectures. - **Required readings** are identified for each class and should be completed as preparation before coming to class. - **Optional readings** are useful for the class topics and I encourage you read them bfore the class.
