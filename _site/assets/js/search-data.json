It is highly recommended that students attend the course regularly, as the sessions will be offered synchronously and will not be recorded. We will use class time to do necessary activities. Class attendance and participation are integral parts of this course; much of the key material will be introduced and discussed in lectures. Good note-taking skills are essential, since the instructor often discusses material and provides examples that may not be directly quoted on the slides. Students are expected to keep track of the schedule and assignment due dates. According to the estimates for UW courses, it should take about 9 hours of work to complete a three-credit class each week. If you spend more than 5 hours beyond the classroom, please let us know, and we will adjust the study plans for you. The total scores will be curved and transformed into the UW numerical grading system for graduate courses, ranging from 4.0 to 1.7 in 0.1 increments as the final grade. Late days: You will have 6 penalty-free late days in total (max 3 late days per assignment). Any delayed submission after the first 3 days will be penalized 10% per day for that specific assignment (but will not count towards your used late days). Labs (60%) . There will be a total of 8 labs. HW 0 is intended for reviewing mathematical concepts and will not be added to the total grade; 5% each for the other 8 assignments. Each assignment will take approximately one week, and the expected finish time is around 2-3 hours. Each student is expected to submit their own assignments, but study groups are allowed. But you’re expected to acknowledge the names of collaborators along with a short description of the types of collaborations being done at the beginning of each assignment submission. You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT, but please check the AI policy section. Details for each homework will be released after the previous homework is due. All homework will be due at 11:59 pm Pacific Time and should be submitted on Canvas. You can typeset or scan your assignment, but you should upload a PDF rather than submitting as images. Final Projects (30%) . There will be a ﬁnal exam in the final week (based on UW’s arrangement). The exam will cover all the content in modules 1-4, including topics like descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression. The exam is closed-book; however, each student is permitted to bring a letter-size double-sided cheat sheet. Calculators will be provided if computation is needed, but you are allowed to bring your own calculators. Participation (10%) . ",

Acts of academic misconduct may include, but are not limited to: . | Cheating (working collaboratively on quizzes and exams, sharing answers, etc.). | Plagiarism (using another person’s words or ideas without proper citation). | Unauthorized collaboration (working with others on assignments without acknowledgment). | Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication. | .

The instructions for each assignment will include information about whether and how you may use AI-based tools to complete the assignment. All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. Detailed citation guidelines can be found at the UW Law Library, MIT Libraries, and the UMD Libraries. Using AI in ways inconsistent with the parameters above will be considered academic misconduct and subject to investigation. Please note that AI results can be biased and inaccurate. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. Additionally, pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content you share, so be careful not to unintentionally share copyrighted materials, original work, or personal information. Learning how to thoughtfully and strategically use AI-based tools may help you develop your skills, refine your work, and prepare you for your future career. If you have any questions about citations or about what constitutes academic integrity in this course or at the University of Washington, please feel free to contact me to discuss your concerns. According to the academic integrity requirements, we prohibit the use of AI-based tools to complete assignments and exams, as well as conducting discussions and reflections in any section during class. However, we encourage students to use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to assist with coding, debugging, and understanding class content. You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, as you would use a human collaborator. This means that you may NOT directly ask generative AI tools for answers or copy solutions. You’re required to acknowledge generative AI tools as collaborators and include a paragraph describing how you used the tool. The use of generative AI tools to substantially complete an assignment or exam (e.g., by directly copying) is prohibited and will result in honor code violations. We will be checking students’ assignments to enforce this policy. ",
