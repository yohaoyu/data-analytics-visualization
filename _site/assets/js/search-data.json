    "content": "As we learn more about data visualization, we have begun to discuss some general principles. For today’s lab exercise, please find an example of a visualization or infographic that impresses you- either in a good or bad way. Please attach the example image, give the link/source, and (1) describe what the visualization is trying to communicate; (2) discuss what it does and does not do well using the principles we talked about in class; (3) comment on two visualizations posted by classmates . -– . A few probing questions to think about: . | Is the data visualization static, motion or interactive? | Is it narrative or explorative? | What kind of purpose do you think it serves? How would you order its objectives (appeal, comprehension and retention)? | Does it contain the basic elements of a graph (e.g. title, axis label, encoding)? Is anything missing or not clear to audience? | What kind of encoding does it use (e.g. position, length, slope, angle, area, color hue, etc)? How effective in terms of precision of such encoding elements? | What kind of organization principles do you observe (e.g.hierarchy, unity, balance, grouping and spacing)? Is principle lacking in the graph? | Do you think your psychological needs have all been met by this source (e.g. autonomy, relatedness and competence)? | . ",

    "title": "Lab 3.2: Sketching Dataset",
    "content": "In this exercise, you will sketch (with pen and paper!) 3 visualizations of a small dataset and provide brief reflections of your designs. Why sketch? Why not just dive right into coding or using some visualization tool? Sketching is a quick and cheap form of prototyping — a process of simulating how a finished product could look and work. Prototyping is a critical part of the design process as it allows us to test the feasibility of our ideas early on. But prototyping (and sketching, in particular) is also extremely helpful in generating ideas. Rather than grappling with the functionality of any given design tool (which can often influence your design process, even implicitly), or committing to any one specific design, sketching allows us to more rapidly explore the space of possible designs. In this assignment, you are going to gain some practice with sketching visualizations. Redfin Monthly Housing Market Data . Each week, Redfin releases a dataset about the housing market, computed daily as either a rolling 1, 4 or 12-week window. The local data is grouped by metropolitan area and by county. The dataset contains information such as median sale price, home sales, pending sales, new listings, inventory, active listings, monthly supply, days on market, price per square foot, sale to list ratio, percent of home sold above list, percent of active listing with price drops, and percent of homes go off market within two weeks. The attached dataset contains the above information aggregated for all types of homes. Dataset: Redfin_SEA_Metro_Au2024.csvDownload Redfin_SEA_Metro_Au2024.csv . Source: https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/Links to an external site. Your Tasks . | Start by choosing a question you’d like a visualization to answer. | Design 3 different visualization paper sketches (low-fidelity prototypes) that you believe effectively tackle the question. | Write one paragraph per sketch about the rationale for your design decisions. What was your motivation behind generating this sketch? What Ire you hoping it would communicate? What worked and what didn’t? | Write one paragraph that reflects on all 3 of your sketches overall. Compare your designs with each other — what are their strengths and weaknesses? What new directions might you explore (e.g., synthesizing elements from every sketch, or describing why one of them is significantly better than the others?). | . Your sketches should be interpretable without consulting your write-ups. Do not forget to include the title, axis labels or legends as needed! . The goal of this assignment is to draft different visualization designs. Thus, I do not expect your visualizations to be “perfect,” but rather communicate three ideas that you would plausibly be excited to continue exploring in the subsequent assignment. In fact, I encourage you to use sharpies/markers/felt-tip pens so that your lines are thicker and you are less focused on being “accurate.” . Note: For this assignment, you should not analyze or visualize the data with tools such as Excel, Tableau, or R. I instead expect you to just look at the dataset and create hand-drawn sketches. Grading . This assignment is scored out of a maximum of 10 points. I will determine scores by judging the diversity of your sketches, the creativity of your ideas, and the crispness of your write ups. You can be awarded a maximum of 3 points for each sketch and its related reflection. The remaining 1 point will be awarded for communicating your overall reflection across the 3 sketches as described in the above section “Your Tasks”. Submission Details . This is an individual assignment. You may not work in groups. Submit your assignment on canvas. Compile your sketches and writeups as a single PDF or WORD file. Make sure your images are sized for a reasonable viewing experience — readers should not have to zoom or scroll in order to effectively view any sketch! . Tips and Inspiration . | Use a sharpie/marker. Thick lines free you from worrying about the fine-grained details and accuracy of your sketch, and instead focus you on sketching the big picture ideas. | Similarly, I recommend using pens over pencils — not being able to “undo” your mistakes by erasing them can be remarkably conducive to generating designs. | You are free to use different colors and any other sketching techniques you can think of (e.g., dotted patterns, cross hatching, etc.). | You may sketch on touchscreen-enabled devices (e.g., iPads). | How to Sketch, Doodle, and Draw Data Visualization Drafts by HandLinks to an external site. | Sketching with Data Opens the Mind’s EyeLinks to an external site. | .

Be sure to use the function I have in the .Rmd to correct the standard errors for heteroskedasticity. | Your first specification should be a naive model, the most basic kind of regression that connects two variables together. | Your second should include multiple regressors (while being cautious to avoid introducing perfect/imperfect multicollinearity, i.e. variables that are highly correlated with each other) | Your third specification should include some sort of controls for fixed effects (such as at the state level, MSA level etc.) | . Select the model you think explains the relationship the best using adjusted R2, F-statistic, AIC, BIC (use what you think makes sense). Then interpret each of the regression coefficients. What does the intercept represent in your chosen model? . Write one paragraph that explains why this relationship might exist in the data. Even if you are not confident in the accuracy of the coefficient, its sign might give you some information about the relationship between these variables. ModelVisualization.RmdDownload ModelVisualization.Rmd . -—- . Play around with how you enter the variables into your model, such as taking the natural log, introducing some terms that are squares or cubes, or interact two variables. Remember that when you introduce a higher order term such as Var^2 you must also include its lower order in your specification ex: var + var^2. The same is true for variables that are interacted together. This lesson could be, and often is, an entire class, so just try and get the gist. I want to expose you to these types of statistics because they are used often by data analysts and will lay the foundation for forecasting. ",

It is highly recommended that students attend the course regularly, as the sessions will be offered synchronously and will not be recorded. We will use class time to do necessary activities. Class attendance and participation are integral parts of this course; much of the key material will be introduced and discussed in lectures. Good note-taking skills are essential, since the instructor often discusses material and provides examples that may not be directly quoted on the slides. Students are expected to keep track of the schedule and assignment due dates. According to the estimates for UW courses, it should take about 9 hours of work to complete a three-credit class each week. If you spend more than 5 hours beyond the classroom, please let us know, and we will adjust the study plans for you. The total scores will be curved and transformed into the UW numerical grading system for graduate courses, ranging from 4.0 to 1.7 in 0.1 increments as the final grade. Late days: You will have 6 penalty-free late days in total (max 3 late days per assignment). Any delayed submission after the first 3 days will be penalized 10% per day for that specific assignment (but will not count towards your used late days). Labs (64%) . There will be a total of 8 labs and 8% each for each lab. Each lab will take approximately one week, and the expected finish time is around 1~2 hours after class. You only need to submit once after each lab. Each student is expected to submit their own lab, but study groups are allowed. But you’re expected to acknowledge the names of collaborators along with a short description of the types of collaborations being done at the beginning of each lab submission. You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT, but please check the AI policy section. All labs will be due at 11:59 pm Pacific Time and should be submitted on Canvas. The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other files required to rerun the codes. Final Projects (27%) . There will be a ﬁnal exam in the final week (based on UW’s arrangement). The exam will cover all the content in modules 1-4, including topics like descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression. The exam is closed-book; however, each student is permitted to bring a letter-size double-sided cheat sheet. Calculators will be provided if computation is needed, but you are allowed to bring your own calculators. Participation (9%) . ",

You may use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, as you would use a human collaborator. This means that you may NOT directly ask generative AI tools for answers or copy solutions. You’re required to acknowledge generative AI tools as collaborators and include a paragraph describing how you used the tool.
