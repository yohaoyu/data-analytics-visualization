<!-- Notes about the HTML and CSS file

I use the R package `cleanrmd` (https://github.com/gadenbuie/cleanrmd) which includes many beautiful themes to render this page. Also, I made some customization using the CSS file provided in the same folder. You may need install `cleanrmd` and have the CSS file in the same folder with `rmd` file to knit the same page. If you want to use the default style. 

You can change the output below to html_document, like:

<!-- start of the main lab content -->
<p><strong>Welcome to start the journey in data science!</strong>
Through this quarter, we will learn how to conduct data analysis and
visualization using <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>, <a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio">RStudio</a>, and <a href="https://www.tableau.com">Tableau</a>. There are tons of resources,
both online and within University of Washington, for you to start
learning data science, check <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/resources/">resource
page</a>.</p>
<p>We will have <strong>8</strong> labs in total (2~3 classes for each
lab) and you only need to submit <strong>once</strong> after each lab.
The due day for each lab can be found on the <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/">course
wesbite</a>. The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other
files required to rerun the codes.</p>
<p>Please check <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#course-requirements">grading
policy of this class</a> in advance, including grade curving, late date
policy, etc. <strong>For Lab 1–3, the use of any generative AI tool
(ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) is prohibited</strong>. We will run AI
detection on each submission. More information about <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#academic-integrity">Academic

<h3 id="why-r-and-rstudio">Why R and RStudio?</h3>
<p>R is a programming language built for statistical computing. But, if
one already knows Stata or similar software, why use R?</p>
<ul>
<li>R is <em>free</em>, so you don’t need a terminal server.</li>
<li>R has a <em>very</em> large community.</li>
<li>R can handle virtually any data format.</li>
<li>R makes replication easy.</li>
<li>R is a <em>language</em> so it can do <em>everything</em>.</li>
<li>R skills transfer to other languages like <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>R Studio is a “front-end” or integrated development environment (IDE)
for R that can make your life <em>easier</em>. We’ll show RStudio
can…</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize your code, output, and plots</li>
<li>Auto-complete code and highlight syntax</li>
<li>Help view data and objects</li>
<li>Enable easy integration of R code into documents with <em>R
Markdown</em></li>
<li>Manage <a href="https://git-scm.com"><code>git</code></a>
repositories</li>
<li>Run interactive tutorials</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selling-you-on-r-markdown">Selling you on R Markdown</h3>
<p>The ability to create R Markdown files is a powerful advantage of
R:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document analyses by combining text, code, and output
<ul>
<li>No copying and pasting into Word</li>
<li>Easy for collaborators to understand</li>
<li>Show as little or as much code as you want</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Produce many different document types as output
<ul>
<li>PDF documents</li>
<li>HTML webpages and reports</li>
<li>Word and PowerPoint documents</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Works with <a href="https://www.latex-project.org"><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span></a> and HTML for math and more
formatting control</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="r-and-rstudio-installation">R and RStudio Installation</h3>
<p>Try to complete the setup before the first class. The goal of this
assignment is simply to make sure that you have R up and running and can
open the source document of this page, a <code>rmd</code> (R Markdown)
file.</p>
<p>If R &amp; RStudio aren’t running and installing properly you may
need to update your operating system. Don’t worry too much if you can’t
get them installed and running, I just want everyone to make an attempt
which should save you time later on.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download and install R, see here: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>Download and install RStudio Desktop, see here: <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsnGd6p9oTk">Windows video
guide</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NvvydRwxEI">Mac
video guide</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latest version of R is <strong>4.5.1 (Great Square
Root).</strong> You can check by typing <code>R.version</code> into your
RStudio Console or run it in one chunk.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>Open up RStudio now and try to download the source file, a
<code>rmd</code> (R Markdown) file <a href="https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/labs/lab-01.zip">here</a>
and open it on your local machine.</p>
<p>Use <code>install.packages(&quot;[package name]&quot;)</code> to install any
required packages, or R Studio may automatically recognize that there
are some packages you need to install and will install them for you.</p>
<p>Then, let’s get oriented with the interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Top Left</em>: Code <strong>editor</strong> pane, data viewer
(browse with tabs)</li>
<li><em>Bottom Left</em>: <strong>Console</strong> for running code
(<code>&gt;</code> prompt)</li>
<li><em>Top Right</em>: List of objects in <strong>environment</strong>,
code <strong>history</strong> tab.</li>
<li><em>Bottom Right</em>: Tabs for browsing files, viewing plots,
managing packages, and viewing help files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can change the layout and theme in <em>Preferences &gt; Pane
Layout/Appearance</em>.</p>

<h2 id="lab-01-b-basic-of-rrstudio-and-markdown">Lab 01-B: Basic of
R/RStudio and Markdown</h2>
<h3 id="r-markdown">R Markdown</h3>
<p>Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and
MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>. In the lab, we will review
some basic Markdown syntax: <a href="https://markdownlivepreview.com">Markdown Live Preview</a>.</p>
<p>You can put some math <span class="math inline">\(y=
\left(\frac{2}{3} \right)^2\)</span> right up in there using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org"><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span></a>. <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i =
\bar{x}_n\]</span> <em>Note:</em> <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> is not required in this class. If
you are curious about how mathematicians compile their books, you may
refer to the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">Learn
LaTeX in 30 minutes</a> from <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>. Overleaf is the most

<h4 id="r-markdown-documents">R Markdown Documents</h4>
<p>This document is a R Markdown file, you can create a new one by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose <em>File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown…</em></li>
<li>Make sure <em>HTML Output</em> is selected and click OK (select PDF
if you’d like PDF as outputs)</li>
<li>Save the file somewhere, call it <code>any_name.Rmd</code></li>
<li>Click the <em>Knit HTML</em> button</li>
<li>Watch the progress in the R Markdown pane, then gaze upon your
result!</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also open up the HTML file in your computer’s browser if you
so desire, using the <em>Open in Browser</em> button at the top of the
preview window.</p>
<h4 id="r-markdown-headers">R Markdown Headers</h4>
<p>The header of an .Rmd file is a <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>
code block, and everything else is part of the main document. To mess
with global formatting, <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html">you can
modify the header</a>.</p>
<pre><code>---

<!-- TODO: Using Markdown for your Resume / CV-->
<h3 id="todousing-markdown-for-your-resume-cv">📚️ TODO:Using Markdown
for your Resume / CV</h3>
<p><strong>4 points</strong></p>
<p><em>Create a brief Resume / CV using R Markdown with your name as
level 4 headings, headings for (at least) education or employment. Each
of the sections should include a bullet list of jobs/degrees. Highlight
the year in bold. Try and incorporate as many R Markdown features as
possible. You can work on this document or create a new markdown
file.</em></p>
<h3 id="r-code-in-r-markdown">R Code in R Markdown</h3>
<p>Inside RMarkdown, lines of R code are called <strong>chunks</strong>.
Code is sandwiched between sets of three backticks and <code>{r}</code>.
This chunk of code…</p>
<pre><code>```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5,6))
```</code></pre>
<p>Produces this output in your document:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">mean</span>(<span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">6</span>)) <span class="co"># calculate the mean value of a list of numbers</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.5</code></pre>
<p>Most commonly used two shortcuts for chunks:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 32%" />
<col style="width: 34%" />
<col style="width: 32%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Action</th>
<th>Mac Shortcut</th>
<th>Windows Shortcut</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Insert R code chunk</td>
<td>⌘ + Option + I</td>
<td>Ctrl + Alt + I</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Run current chunk</td>
<td>⌘ + Option + C</td>
<td>Ctrl + Alt + C</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="chunk-options">Chunk Options</h4>
<p>Chunks have options that control what happens with their code, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>echo=FALSE</code>: Keeps R code from being shown in the
document</li>
<li><code>eval=FALSE</code>: Shows R code in the document without
running it</li>
<li><code>include=FALSE</code>: Hides all output but still runs code
(good for <code>setup</code> chunks where you load packages!)</li>
<li><code>results=&#39;hide&#39;</code>: Hides R’s (non-plot) output from the
document</li>
<li><code>cache=TRUE</code>: Saves results of running that chunk so if
it takes a while, you won’t have to re-run it each time you re-knit the
document</li>
<li><code>fig.height=5, fig.width=5</code>: modify the dimensions of any
plots that are generated in the chunk (units are in inches)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these can be modified using the gear-shaped <em>Modify Chunk
Options</em> button in each chunk. <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/options/">There are a <em>lot</em> of
other options, however</a>.</p>
<h4 id="editing-and-running-code">Editing and Running Code</h4>
<p>In R Markdown documents, click within a code chunk and click the
green arrow to run the chunk. The button beside that runs <em>all prior
chunks</em>. The console will show the lines you ran followed by any
printed output. There are more options on the top right of this window
(green arrow with <code>Run</code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>pi <span class="co"># output the value of pi</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.141593</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes we want to insert a value directly into our text. We do
that using code in single backticks starting off with <code>r</code>.
For example, the value of <code>pi</code> rounded to the nearest three
decimals is 3.142.</p>

<p><code>sqrt()</code> is an example of a <strong>function</strong> in
R. If we didn’t have a good guess as to what <code>sqrt()</code> will
do, we can type <code>?sqrt</code> in the console and look at the
<strong>Help</strong> panel on the right.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>?sqrt <span class="co"># what is sqrt()? </span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are the <em>inputs</em> to a function. In
this case, the only argument to <code>sqrt()</code> is <code>x</code>
which can be a number or a vector of numbers. <em>Help</em> files
provide documentation on how to use functions and what functions
produce.</p>
<h4 id="common-data-types-in-r">Common Data Types in R</h4>
<p>R has several <em>basic data types</em> that are used to build larger
data structures.</p>

<h3 id="data-structures-in-r">Data Structures in R</h3>
<h4 id="objects">Objects</h4>
<p>R stores everything as an <strong>object</strong>, including data,
functions, models, and output. Creating an object can be done using the
assignment operator: <code>&lt;-</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_object_preferred <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">144</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_object_not_preferred <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dv">144</span> <span class="co"># using `=` is OK in R but not recommended; `=` is mainly for function arguments</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <em>Environment Pane</em> (right top) shows all active objects
once you created in your current R session. Each assignment
(<code>&lt;-</code>) updates this list. Then. you can display or ‘use’
an object simply by using its name.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_object_preferred</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 144</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sqrt</span>(new_object_preferred)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<p>Object names can contain <code>_</code> (preferred) and
<code>.</code> in them but CANNOT begin with numbers. Try to be
consistent and clear in naming objects. Clear naming will help you save
lots of time in the future!</p>
<h4 id="vectors">Vectors</h4>
<p>Vector is a sequence of elements of the same type.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>numbers <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>)       <span class="co"># numeric vector; `c()` means combine</span></span>

<h3 id="dataframes-1">Dataframes</h3>
<p>Most data sets you will work with will be read into R and stored as a
<strong>dataframe</strong>, just like the <code>king_value</code> data.
So this course will mainly focus on manipulating and visualizing these
objects.</p>
