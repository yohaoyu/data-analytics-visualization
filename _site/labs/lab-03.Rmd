<!-- start of the main lab content --> 

The due day for each lab can be found on the [course wesbite](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/). The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other files required to rerun the codes. **For Lab 1–3, the use of any generative AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) is prohibited**. We will run AI detection on each submission.

## Lab 03-B: A Little Programming, Visualization and GitHub


### Very Simple Git and GitHub

- Every change you make is saved in history, so you can always go back.
- If something breaks, you can roll back to a working version.
- Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other.
- Your code and documents are safe, even if your computer crashes.
- Most of the data science ecosystem (R packages, Python libraries, statistical models, tutorials) lives on GitHub.

There are two main ways to use GitHub:

1. Terminal (Command Line) – more powerful and professional, gives you full control.
2. [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) – easier for beginners, has a user-friendly interface.

We will using GitHub Desktop:

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
2. [Sign up a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
3. Sign in with your GitHub account on GitHub Desktop.
4. Create a [new public repository](https://github.com/new).
5. Click “Clone a repository” to copy from GitHub to your computer.
6. Add this `.Rmd` and `html` to your local repository.
7. Commit changes with a short message (e.g., “Lab 1 for RE 519”).
8. Click “Push origin” to upload your changes back to GitHub.
9. You can check your changes on GitHub now.
