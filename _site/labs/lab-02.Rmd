The due day for each lab can be found on the [course wesbite](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/). The submission should include Rmd, html, and any other files required to rerun the codes. **For Lab 1â€“3, the use of any generative AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) is prohibited**. We will run AI detection on each submission.

## Lab 02-A: Modifying Dataframes

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
```

### Pipe - A Unique Feature of R

One of the most distinctive features of R (especially through the tidyverse) is the pipe operator `%>%` or `|>`.

- chain commands together in a clear, left-to-right order.
- Instead of nesting multiple functions, you can read code step by step.
- closer to natural language and easier to follow in data analysis workflows.

| System        | Windows/Linux    | Mac             |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Pipe Shortcut | Ctrl + Shift + M | Cmd + Shift + M |

```{r}
# example without pipe
mean(log(sqrt(c(1, 4, 9, 16))))
# example with pipe
c(1, 4, 9, 16) %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  log() %>%
  mean()
```
