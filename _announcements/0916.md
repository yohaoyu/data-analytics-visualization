Welcome to RE 519 Data Analytics and Visualization in Autumn 2025. We are looking forward to meeting you in person on our first day of class (Wednesday, September 24, 2025). The [course website](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/) will be the main place for all course information and materials. We will use [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1833875) as a place for submitting assignments and for grading purposes. [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/86258/discussion) will be used for announcements, discussion, and technical questions.
