Hi all, thanks for submitting the first lab and all have done a **fatalistic** job! 

Things are getting complicated for the lab 2. So, please be feel to [book online/in-person office hour here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ2EtqybbA68awqzWkk53rxGxuiNCS0W4pbkZdc=?gv=true) if you encounter any technical problems in the assignment. 

For GitHub, you need to commit and push your lab 2 to GitHub repo. You don't have to publish your lab as a webpage (like we did on Wednesday), but it will be pretty cool that show those works as a webpage you've done with others!

For the final project, please email me or form the group on Canvas if you have not done: [details here!](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/projects/#team-formation)
