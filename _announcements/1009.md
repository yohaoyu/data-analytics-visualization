Hi all, thanks for submitting the first lab and all has done a **fatalistic** job! 

Things are getting complicated for the lab 2. So, please be free to [book online/in-person office hour here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ2EtqybbA68awqzWkk53rxGxuiNCS0W4pbkZdc=?gv=true) if you encounter any technical problems in the assignment. 

For GitHub, you need to commit and push your lab 2 to the GitHub repo. You don't have to publish your lab as a webpage (like we did on Wednesday), but it will be pretty cool that show those works as a webpage you've done with others! We will talk more about making webpages later! 

For the final project, please email me or form the group on Canvas if you have not done: [details here!](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/projects/#team-formation)
