Dear all, I know that, for many of you, coding can feel challenging at the beginning. After all, we are communicating with computers in a new language and logic. To help you navigate the first few weeks, I have made some adjustments and would like to emphasize a few points about the labs.

1. Please review the example codes of lab 1 in `rmd` or [this page](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/labs/lab-01) and test the codes using your RStudio. You can find almost all key points for the TODO tasks. 
1. You can work on `lab-01.rmd` directly for the lab or create a new `.rmd` file. Please submit **both** `.rmd` and `.HTML` files on Canvas. 
1. If you have any clarification and coding questions, please first post them on [Ed Discussion, especially on the lab 1 megathread if the question is about lab 1](https://edstem.org/us/courses/86258/discussion/7047765) and please help others if you can!
1. Lab 1 will be due *next Monday* (Oct 6) and we do have a [late days policy](https://www.yuehaoyu.com/data-analytics-visualization/syllabus/#course-requirements). If you need accommodations and please contact [Disability Resources for Students (DRS)](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/). 
1. I will open more time slots for office hours and please [book them online here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ2EtqybbA68awqzWkk53rxGxuiNCS0W4pbkZdc=?gv=true).
1.	I will record all future in-class lab sessions so that you can review them later if needed. 

Meanwhile, if you are interested in getting access to [CoStar](https://www.costar.com/) during this quarter, please follow [the instruction to apply](https://edstem.org/us/courses/86258/discussion/7047021) before *next Monday* (Oct 6).
