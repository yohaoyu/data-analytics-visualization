Dear all, Canvas is now back online, and **Lab 3 is due tonight (October 21)**.

We will not have class on Tuesday, October 22, as I’ll be attending the [ACSP Annual Conference 2025](https://www.acsp.org/page/ConfAbout) in Minneapolis. Please use this time to continue **working on Lab 4 and try to explore more possibilities** of `ggplot2`! Lab 4 will be due next Wednesday (October 29).

Next Monday (October 27), we’ll welcome Drew Dolan (Principal, DXD Capital) for a guest lecture on data-driven real estate investment. Please participate in person if you are available.
