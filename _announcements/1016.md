Dear all, thank you for submitting Lab 2, and you are doing a wonderful job! Here are the descriptive statistics: Mean: 15.4; Median: 15.8; Standard Deviation: 1.2. 

For Lab 3, please notice that there are five questions, even though only two are shown in the HTML table of contents: (1) Handle Missing Values; (2) The Variety of Histograms; (3) The Variety of Boxplots; (4) Review Diagrams; (5) Explore National Mortgage Database.

Next week, we will not have class on October 22 because I'm heading to Minneapolis for the [ACSP Annual Conference 2025](https://www.acsp.org/page/ConfAbout). Please use the time to work on the following Lab 4. Also, my office hours availability will be very limited next week, and my response may have some level of delay. Sorry for that!
